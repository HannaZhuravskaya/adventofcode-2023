# Advent of Code 2023

Don't have time this year to learn new language, but still want to solve some tasks.

Language of 2023: **Python**

Decided to make some notes on the useful things I found/learned/rediscovered during the event.

- **Day 10**: [Pick's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem) and [Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) would save few hours of my life
